In this lab, we aimed to familiarize ourselves with Natural Language Processing (NLP) language models using the Sklearn library. The lab consisted of two main parts: Language Modeling with Regression and Language Modeling with Classification.

In the first part, we performed the following tasks:
1. Established a preprocessing NLP pipeline, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop words removal, and discretization, on the collected dataset.
2. Encoded the data vectors using various techniques such as Word2Vec (CBOW) and TF-IDF.
3. Trained regression models including SVR, Linear Regression,Extra tree,random forest,gradient boosting and Decision Tree algorithms using Word2Vec embeddings.
4. Evaluated the regression models using standard metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ² score., and selected the best model based on the evaluation results.
5. Interpreted the obtained results to draw insights and conclusions about the regression models' performance.

In the second part, we conducted the following steps:
1. Established a preprocessing NLP pipeline similar to the first part but tailored for classification tasks.
2. Encoded the data vectors using Word2Vec (CBOW) and TF-IDF.
3. Trained classification models including SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression,XGBoost and AdaBoosting algorithms using Word2Vec embeddings.
4. Evaluated the classification models using standard metrics such as Accuracy, Loss, and F1 Score, and selected the best model based on the evaluation results.
5. Interpreted the obtained results to draw insights and conclusions about the classification models' performance.

Overall, this lab provided hands-on experience in preprocessing text data, encoding it into numerical representations using various techniques, training different types of models, evaluating their performance using standard metrics, and interpreting the results to make informed decisions about model selection and optimization strategies. In addition, it's worth mentioning that while traditional machine learning algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression have been widely used in NLP tasks, neural networks have emerged as a powerful alternative for modeling language. Neural networks, especially deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer models, have shown remarkable performance in various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and language generation. Furthermore, ensemble learning techniques, which combine multiple models to improve predictive performance, have also gained popularity in NLP. Algorithms like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forests have been successfully applied to language modeling tasks, often achieving superior results by leveraging the diversity of multiple models.

In summary, while traditional machine learning approaches have their merits, neural networks and ensemble learning techniques have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in modeling language and are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for NLP tasks due to their ability to capture complex patterns in textual data and generalize well to diverse language domains.
